				Swift's mark as a musician has always been the fact that she writes all of her own music, both with and without other co-writers.
				In fact, following her 2010 Grammy Album of the Year win for her album Fearless, critics claimed that she would not have been able to win without the help of her co-writers.
				In response, Swift penned her next album, Speak Now, entirely by herself.
				Her lyricism and storytelling has always been what connected Swift to her fans.
				Let's take a deeper look into the worlds Swift creates through her music.
