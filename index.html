					Born in 1989 with an early affinity to music, Taylor Alison Swift signed a 13-year record deal at the mere age of 15.
					One year later, in 2006, Swift released her debut, self-titled album — Taylor Swift.

					Nearly two decades since the release of her debut album, which spent 24 weeks at number one on Top Country Albums
					and received the coveted Album of the Year Grammy nomination, <i>how can Swift still be climbing to the peak of her career?</i>

			</div>
			<div class="flex-col right">
				<p class="text-box"  style="background: #88D9E6;" data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-duration="2000">

					This year, she kicked off the North and South American legs of her Eras Tour — a 3 hour and 45 minute concert of 44 songs from the different eras of her life.
					The Eras Tour shifted economies, with Swift selling out 70k+ seat stadiums across multiple nights and garnering a shout-out from the Federal Reserve as a major contributing factor to local economy booms.

					The mania around Swift is rooted in her connection to her fans. Taylor Swift is <i>beloved</i> (and even that feels like an understatement) by her fanbase of Swifties —
					in fact, at Lumen Field in Seattle, WA, fans cheered so loud that seismographs registered the roar of the crowd as a 2.3 magnitude earthquake.

				In 2018, upon the completion of her original deal, Swift signed a new record deal with Universal Music Group,
				one she hoped would give her more creative freedom over her work.
				<br><br>
				Under this deal, Swift has released 8 albums, including 4 re-recordings of her previous work and 4 original albums.
				She has released more albums in the past five years than she did in the first fifteen years of her career.
				<br><br>
				Swift attributes this to the trust and freedom she has under with her new label, where her decisions are welcomed and encouraged.
			</p>
			<p data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-duration="1500" class="plain-text">
				Let's take a look, then, at how Swift has stacked up against her peers in the music industry in this time.

				Swift's mark as a musician has always been the fact that she is a songwriter on all of her songs.
				Following her 2010 Album of the Year Grammy win for her album Fearless, critics claimed that she would not have been able to win without the help of her co-writers.
				In response, Swift penned her next album, Speak Now, entirely by herself.

				Swift has an uncanny ability to capture stories and build narrative arcs.
				She writes lyrics from the most vulnerable and honest parts of herself, and somehow, it speaks directly to the hearts and experiences of her fans.
				Known for both addicting pop radio production and a heartwrenching power ballad, Swift creates new worlds
				for her listeners to sink into, and she often does this by leveraging literary devices to engage various themes.
