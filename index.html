					Born in 1989 with an early affinity to music, Taylor Alison Swift signed a 13-year record deal at the mere age of 15.
					One year later, in 2006, Swift released her debut, self-titled album — Taylor Swift.

					This year, she kicked off the North and South American legs of her Eras Tour — a 3 hour and 45 minute concert of 44 songs from the different eras of her life.
					The Eras Tour shifted economies, with Swift selling out 70k+ seat stadiums across multiple nights and garnering a shout-out from the Federal Reserve as a major contributing factor to local economy booms.

					The mania around Swift is rooted in her connection to her fans. Taylor Swift is <i>beloved</i> (and even that feels like an understatement) by her fanbase of Swifties —
					in fact, at Lumen Field in Seattle, WA, fans cheered so loud that seismographs registered the roar of the crowd as a 2.3 magnitude earthquake.

				In 2018, upon the completion of her original deal, Swift signed a new record deal with Universal Music Group,
				one she hoped would give her more creative freedom over her work.
				<br><br>
				Under this deal, Swift has released 8 albums, including 4 re-recordings of her previous work and 4 original albums.
				She has released more albums in the past five years than she did in the first fifteen years of her career.
				<br><br>
				Swift attributes this to the trust and freedom she has under with her new label, where her decisions are welcomed and encouraged.

					for hours just hoping to get a chance to try and buy tickets. Tickets on the resale market sold for as high as $20,000.

					Swift is known for her autobiographical storytelling (though her pandemic albums, <i>folklore</i> and <i>evermore</i> were an unexpected and
					sharp departure from this pattern). At a young age, Swift's family moved from Reading, PA to Nashville, TN in hopes of helping her kickstart her music career.
					Having spent the early part of her career as an incredibly successful country artist, she made the unprecedented decision in 2014 to fully transition to the pop genre.

					In her 1989 (Taylor's Version) prologue, she writes, "When I was 24, I decided to completely reinvent myself." She did this by chopping her long curly hair, moving to New York City,
					and writing one of the most awarded pop albums of all time — 1989. This era for Swift was defined by paparazzi photos in the streets of New York City and girl groups, and it reflected
					in the music she wrote.
					<br><br>
					More than any other place, Taylor Swift references New York in her lyrics. There's the obvious
					"Welcome to New York," but songs like "Mean," "Come Back," "Holy Ground," "False God,"
					"Daylight" and "Hoax" all include a generic New York reference as well.
